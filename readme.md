# WordWise

**WordWise** is a Python-based web application that leverages generative AI models from Google AI to solve mathematical word problems. It is designed to assist users in understanding and solving complex mathematical scenarios by providing detailed step-by-step solutions.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind WordWise stems from the need to make mathematical problem-solving more accessible and intuitive. Traditional problem-solving methods can be challenging for many individuals, and WordWise aims to bridge that gap by harnessing the power of generative AI to simplify mathematical word problems.

## What it Does

WordWise specializes in solving mathematical word problems. Users can input a problem statement, and the application, powered by Google's generative AI models, provides comprehensive solutions, breaking down each step in a clear and understandable manner.

## How We Built It

WordWise is built using Python and the Flask web framework. It integrates with Google's generative AI models (`chat-bison-001` and `text-bison-001`) through the `palm` library. The user interface is crafted using HTML, and Flask handles the backend logic for processing user input and generating solutions.

## Challenges We Ran Into

- **Model Integration:** Integrating and configuring Google's AI models posed challenges, requiring careful consideration of API key management and model-specific nuances.

- **User Interface Design:** Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface that seamlessly interacts with the backend AI models required iterative design and testing.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

- Successful integration of Google's AI models for generating accurate and detailed solutions.

- Development of a clean and user-friendly web interface that enhances the user experience.

## What We Learned

- Enhanced understanding of generative AI models and their application in solving mathematical word problems.

- Improved proficiency in web development using Flask, HTML, and integrating external APIs.

## What's Next for WordWise

- **Enhanced Problem Types:** Expand the range of supported mathematical word problems and cater to various domains.

- **User Accounts and History:** Implement user accounts to track problem-solving history and provide personalized recommendations.

- **Feedback Mechanism:** Introduce a user feedback mechanism to continuously improve the accuracy and clarity of generated solutions.

- **Mobile Accessibility:** Optimize the application for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience on various platforms.
